# [WIP] K8s Deploy Notifier
This is intended to be a simple tool to consume events from K8s, and notify users about these events which could be Pod related CRUD events, deployment related events e.t.c.

When it is completed, it should notify users through a number of configurable channels like Slack, Email, SMS e.t.c.
